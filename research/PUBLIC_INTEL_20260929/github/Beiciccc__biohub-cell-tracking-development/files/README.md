# Biohub Cell Tracking During Development

This repository records experiments for the Kaggle competition
Biohub - Cell Tracking During Development.

The task is to detect cells in 3D time-lapse microscopy volumes and link them
across time into lineage graphs. The public record contains the project
description and experiment results. Competition notebook publication is handled
on Kaggle.
